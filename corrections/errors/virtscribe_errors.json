The opening '[patient] stephanie morales, medical record number 113322, 44-year-old female who presents today 6 weeks status post right medial unicompartmental arthroplasty' is a doctor's dictation/note, not patient speech. In the work discussion, the segment 'okay. i, i do n't want you lifting greater than five or 10 pounds and no standing or sitting longer than half an hour. usually that means you ca n't do a ups job.' under [patient] tag is doctor's medical restrictions/advice. In the driving discussion, '[patient] we have plenty of data that says normal reflex time is returned at 6 weeks and then your return to driving is determined by when you're ready and feel safe to be driving' is doctor's medical explanation/data, not patient speech."
